			purpose = <"To record a clinical assessment of a propensity, or potential risk to an individual, of an adverse reaction upon future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.

Where a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterised by any harmful or undesirable, physiological response that is unique to the individual, and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance.">
			use = <"Use to provide a single place within the health record to document a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions, including:
- record a clinical assessment of the individual’s propensity to a potential future reaction upon re-exposure; and
- record cumulative information about the reaction to each exposure, including ‘no reaction’ if appropriate.

Use to record information about the positive presence of the risk of an adverse reaction:
- to support direct clinical care of an individual; 
- as part of a managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list; 
- to support exchange of information about the propensity and events related to adverse reactions; 
- to inform adverse reaction reporting; and 
- to assist computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

Use to record information about adverse reactions to a broad range of substances, including: biological & blood products; incipients and excipients in medicinal preparations; metal salts; and organic chemical compounds.  

Adverse reactions may be:
- an immune mediated reaction - Types I-VI (including allergic reactions and hypersensitivities); or 
- a non-immune mediated reaction - including pseudo-allergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, drug toxicities (eg to Gentamicin), drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, and drug-disease interactions.
In clinical practice distinguishing between immune-mediated and non-immune mediated reactions is difficult and often not practical. Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient, which is better expressed by the manifestation in clinical practice.

The risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation should not be recorded without identifying a proposed causative substance or class of substance. If there is uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, this uncertainty can be recorded using the ‘Status’ data element. If there are multiple possible substances that may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this adverse reaction archetype/FHIR resource with the ‘Status’ set to an initial state of ‘Unconfirmed’ so that adverse reaction checking can be supported in clinical systems. If a substance, agent or class is later proven not to be the cause for a given reaction then the ‘Status’ can be modified to ‘Refuted’.

This archetype/FHIR resource has been designed to allow recording of information about a specific substance (amoxycillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or, alternatively, a class of substance (eg Penicillins)). If a class of substance is recorded then identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per exposure basis.

The scope of this archetype/FHIR resource has deliberately focused on identifying a pragmatic data set that are used in most clinical systems or will be suitable for most common clinical scenarios, however it permits extension of the model when additional detail is required, for example 'Reaction details', 'Exposure details', and 'Reporting details' slots. Examples of clinical situations where the extension may be required include: a detailed allergist/immunologist assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or use in a clinical trial.

The act of recording any adverse reaction in a health record involves the clinical assessment that a potential hazard exists for an individual if they are exposed to the same substance/agent/class in the future – that is, a relative contraindication - and the default ‘Criticality’ value should be set to ‘Low risk’. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/agent again, for example, following a manifestation of a life-threatening anaphylaxis, then the 'Criticality' data element should be amended to ‘High risk’. 

A formal Adverse Event Report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details about the adverse reaction. The report could utilise parts of this Risk of adverse reaction archetype/FHIR resource plus include additional data as required per jurisdiction.

An adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list is a record of all identified propensities for an adverse reaction for the individual upon future exposure to the substance or class, plus provides potential access to the evidence provided by details about each reaction event, such as manifestation.

Valuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:
- statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure;
- source of the information/reporter; and
- the ‘Criticality’ flag.
Second-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.

openEHR only: Links to other parts of the health record where further details may be located, such as consultation notes, is allowed by the openEHR reference model, but not modelled explicitly in this archetype.">

Not to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example: abnormal use or mistakes/errors made in maladministration of an agent or substance; incorrect dosage; mislabelling; harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure; overdose/poisoning etc.

Not to be used as a proxy for an Adverse Event Report. See above for how it may be used as one component of an Adverse Event Report.

Not to be used for recording alerts.

Not to be used for recording failed therapy.

openEHR only: Not to be used for the explicit recording of an absence (or negative presence) of a reaction to 'any substances' or to identified substances, for example ‘No known allergies or adverse reactions’ or ‘No known allergies to Penicillin’. Use the EVALUATION. exclusion-adverse_reaction archetype to express a positive statement of adverse reaction exclusion.

openEHR only: Not to be used for the explicit recording that no information was able to be obtained about the adverse reaction status of a patient. Use the EVALUATION.absence archetype to record that a positive statement that information was not able to be obtained, for example, if a non-cooperative patient refuses to answer questions.">
