			use = <"Use to record a narrative description of the overall findings observed during the physical examination of the ears. 

Use as a container archetype - to provide a framework in which specific, detailed CLUSTER archetypes related to ear examination findings can be nested. For example,  CLUSTER.exam_tympanic_membrane, CLUSTER.exam_auditory_canal and CLUSTER.exam.pinna can be inserted into relevant slots to record detailed physical examination findings for a specific ear. In addition the CLUSTER.exclusion_exam can be used to record that an ear examination was not done, if inserted at root level 'Other Details' SLOT, or that examination of a specified ear was not done, if inserted in the 'Details' SLOT of the relevant ear.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">

Not to be used to record data about ear testing - use specific purpose-built OBSERVATION archetypes. For example: OBSERVATION.audiometry_result or OBSERVATION.tympanogram_226hz.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure, OBSERVATION.body_weight, or OBSERVATION.height.">
